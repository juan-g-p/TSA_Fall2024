# The Efficient Market Hypothesis

The goal of this assignment is to compare a prediction strategy based on the Efficiet Market Hypothesis (EMH) with the first of the non-trivial models you will work with: exponential smoothing.

Essentially, the EMH states that stocks are accurately priced and reflect all available information. This makes it impossible to consistently beat the market by analysis.

In his influential 1970 paper ([1]), Eugene Fama proposes three categories of efficiency that differ in the information considered reflected in the prices:

1. *Weak-form of the EMH*: considers information contained in historical prices.
2. *Semi-strong form of EMH*: considers information publicly available beyond historical prices.
3. *Strong-form*: considers private (privileged) information.

Here we are going to consider the weak-form of the EMH and work only with the information contained in historical prices.

# Assignment

The assignment consists in:

**1. Download historical data from a Stock Market Index and generate a dataset with that data. The indexes used will be:**
  
The idea is that you download the data using notebook 4_2, store it as .csv and import it here.

  * **Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500):** tracks the 500 companies with the largest market cap in USA.
  * **Financial Times Stock Exchange:** tracks the 100 companies with the largest market capitalization on the London Stock Exchange.
  
**Your final dataset must be an object of type `tsibble` with the following characteristics**:

* key = symbol
* index = trading_day

```{r, eval = params$run_snippet}
# Use only this code snippet. 
```

```{r}
#SOLUTION
sp500_data <- readr::read_csv("ZZ_Group_Assignment/SP500_Prices.csv")
tr_data <- tr_data %>% as_tsibble(key = symbol, index = 'trading_day')
head(tr_data)
```

The data will consists in the **last 5 years of trading data associated to the index**

**2. Create two training datasets leaving out 60% and 80% of your data**

```{r, eval = params$run_snippet}
# Use only this code snippet. 
# You may add code but only within this code snippet.

# Result:
train_1 <- # Training dataset 1 (80% of observations)
train_2 <- # Training dataset 2 (60% of observations)
```

```{r}
#SOLUTION
n_rows <- nrow(tr_data)
train_1 <- filter(tr_data, trading_day <= (n_rows * 0.8))
train_2 <- filter(tr_data, trading_day <= (n_rows * 0.6))
```

**3. Fit both a Naïve model and a Simple Exponential Smooting model to each of these training datasets**

```{r, eval = params$run_snippet}
fit_tr1 <- train_1 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr1 = # Your code,
    ses_tr1 =  # Your code
  )

fit_tr2 <- train_2 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr2 = # Your code,
    ses_tr2 =  # Your code
  )

fit_tr3 <- train_3 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr3 = # Your code,
    ses_tr3 =  # Your code
  )

# Bind all the models in a single mable to handle forecasts more easily.
fit <- bind_cols(
  fit_tr1 %>% select(-symbol), # Exclude column symbol to be able to bind columns
  fit_tr2 %>% select(-symbol),
  fit_tr3 %>% select(-symbol)
)

fit
```


```{r}
#SOLUTION
fit_tr1 <- train_1 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr1 = NAIVE(close),
    ses_tr1 =  ETS(close ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("N"))
  )

fit_tr2 <- train_2 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr2 = NAIVE(close),
    ses_tr2 =  ETS(close ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("N"))
  )

fit_tr3 <- train_3 %>% 
  model(
    snaive_tr3 = NAIVE(close),
    ses_tr3 =  ETS(close ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("N"))
  )

# Bind all the models in a single mable to handle forecasts more easily.
fit <- bind_cols(
  fit_tr1 %>% select(-symbol), # Exclude column symbol to be able to bind columns
  fit_tr2 %>% select(-symbol),
  fit_tr3 %>% select(-symbol)
)

fit
```

**4. Generate forecasts of 5 trading days for each of the trained models**

The result of this step should be a `fable` or forecast table. Name it `fc`

Add a column `h` to `fc` indicating the forecast horizont of each forecast.

* After adding that column, apply the following command: `as_fable(response = "close", distribution = close)`. This is to ensure that the output after performing these operations is still a fable.

```{r, eval = params$run_snippet}
#USE ONLY THIS CODE SNIPPET
#YOU MAY ADD CODE BUT ONLY WITHIN THIS CODE SNIPPET
fc <-
```


```{r}
#SOLUTION
fc <- fit %>% forecast(h=7)
fc

fc <- fc %>% 
  group_by(.model) %>%
  mutate(h = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  as_fable(response = "close", distribution = close)
```
**5. For each combination of model, training dataset and forecast horizon compute the RMSE, MAE and MAPE. Store the result in a variable called `summary`**

```{r, eval = params$run_snippet}
#USE ONLY THIS CODE FOR YOUR FINAL SOLUTION
summary <-
```


```{r}
#SOLUTION
summary <- accuracy(fc, tr_data, by = c("h", ".model")) %>% select(-c(MPE, MASE, RMSSE, ACF1, ME))
```
**6. Use facet wrap to produce 3 graphs, one for each of the three error metrics used**

The graphs should depict the RMSE for each forecast horizon and for each combination of model and training dataset.

```{r, eval=params$run_snippet}
# USE ONLY THIS CODE SNIPPET FOR YOUR FINAL CODE
```

* Does the training dataset have an effect on the errors?
* Does one of the models outperform the other?

```{r}
#SOLUTION
# Make Dataset Long
summary %>%
  pivot_longer(c(MAE, RMSE, MAPE), names_to = "metric", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = h, y = value, color = .model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ metric, nrow = 2 , scales = "free")
```
**7. Evaluate the same metrics on the same models, but this time using cross validation**

The end-goal is that you produced the same final graph (facet_wrap graph on the error metrics), but this time only two lines per graph should be depicted (one line per model).

The smallest training dataset shall contain 40% of the trading days. The trading datasets shall increase in steps of 1 trading day. You may later repeat this for .steps of 5 and note the difference in running time.

```{r, eval=params$run_snippet}
# WRITE ALL YOUR CODE IN THIS CODE SNIPPET

```

* What is the difference between these graphs and the ones we generated before? Answer briefly below.
* Does one of the models outperform the other?

```{r}
# SOLUTION
tr_data_cv <- tr_data %>%
  stretch_tsibble(.init= trunc(0.4*nrow(tr_data)), .step = 1)

fit_cv <- tr_data_cv %>%
  model(
    snaive_tr2 = NAIVE(close),
    ses_tr2 =  ETS(close ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("N"))
  )

fc_cv <- fit_cv %>% 
  forecast(h = 7) %>%
  group_by(.id, .model) %>%
  mutate(h = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  as_fable(response = "close", distribution = close)

summary_cv <- fc_cv %>%
  accuracy(tr_data, by=c("h", ".model")) %>% select(-c(MPE, MASE, RMSSE, ACF1, ME))

summary_cv %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(MAE, RMSE, MAPE), names_to = "metric", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = h, y = value, color = .model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ metric, nrow = 2 , scales = "free")
```
